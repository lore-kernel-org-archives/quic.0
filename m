quic: add packet parser base

This commit adds the QUIC receive path. quic_packet_rcv() finds the
owning socket by connection ID, by address, or through the listener, then
passes the packet to quic_packet_process(). The patch also adds
listen-side Initial handling, request sockets, ALPN-based listener
switching through a per-socket work item, and ICMP Packet Too Big
handling through quic_packet_rcv_err() and quic_packet_rcv_err_pmtu().

> This patch uses 'quic_packet' to handle packing of QUIC packets on the
> receive (RX) path.

[ ... ]

> - quic_packet_get_alpn(): Parse the ALPN from a client Initial packet,
>   then locate the appropriate listener using the ALPN.

[ ... ]

> - quic_packet_rcv_err_pmtu(): Find the socket and update the PMTU via
>   quic_packet_mss_update().

[Severity: Medium]
Some parts of the commit message don't match the code.

Should "packing" in the first sentence be "parsing"?

quic_packet_get_alpn() installs the Initial keys, decrypts the packet and
parses the ALPN list. It doesn't look up a listener. The lookup and the
switch happen in quic_listen_sock_switch() in net/quic/socket.c.

For ICMP errors, the socket lookup is done in quic_packet_rcv_err(), not
in quic_packet_rcv_err_pmtu().

The message also leaves out much of what the patch adds:

  - quic_packet_listen_process(), with token verification and the
    Stateless Reset, Version Negotiation, Retry and CONNECTION_REFUSED
    triggers
  - struct quic_request_sock and quic_request_sock_lookup(),
    quic_request_sock_create() and quic_request_sock_backlog_tail(),
    which charge sk_ack_backlog and receive memory
  - the per-socket work_struct with deferred_list/backlog_list on
    quic_wq, and flush_work() in quic_packet_free()
  - quic_accept_sock_exists() and quic_listen_sock_switch()
  - quic_backlog_rcv() now processing packets instead of dropping them
  - the ALPN free moving from quic_destroy_sock() to quic_sock_destruct()

Most of this is described only in the changelog below the --- line, and
git am drops that part. Could the permanent commit message cover these
pieces?

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but nothing in this patch uses QUIC_LONG_HLEN().

Two of the new struct quic_packet members are in a similar state.

backlog_list is described as "Packets waiting for crypto keys". It is
only initialized in quic_packet_init() and purged in quic_packet_free(),
and nothing enqueues to it yet.

quic_packet_listen_process() reads validate_peer_address, but nothing
ever sets it, so the token validation and Retry branch can't be reached:

	if (packet->validate_peer_address) {

The changelog says these are staged for the next patchset. Could they be
added together with the code that uses them? Failing that, could the
backlog_list comment describe what the field does today?

[Severity: Medium]
Can a Packet Too Big that reports a larger MTU than the current path MTU
raise the MSS here?

info is only clamped to [QUIC_PATH_MIN_PMTU, QUIC_PATH_MAX_PMTU], and
quic_packet_mss_update() stores whatever it is given. The route layer
ignores increases:

net/ipv4/route.c:__ip_rt_update_pmtu() {
    ...
	old_mtu = ipv4_mtu(dst);
	if (old_mtu < mtu)
		return;
    ...
}

__ip6_rt_update_pmtu() also returns early when mtu >= dst6_mtu(dst).

Nothing in this tree sets plpmtud_interval, so this branch is the
default. A delayed or spoofed ICMP that arrives through quic_udp_err()
-> quic_packet_rcv() -> quic_packet_rcv_err() -> quic_packet_rcv_err_pmtu()
and claims 9000 on a 1500-byte path would set the MSS to 9000 - hlen.

The route is left unchanged, so the cached dst stays valid. Later
quic_packet_route() calls then get 1 back from quic_flow_route() and
never recompute the MSS from dst_mtu().

Would it be safer to re-read dst_mtu(dst) after update_pmtu(), or to only
ever lower the MSS, as tcp_v4_mtu_reduced() does?

[Severity: Medium]
Is a minimum datagram size check missing before this reply?

RFC 9000 sections 5.2.2 and 6.1 say a server MUST drop smaller packets
that specify an unsupported version. Section 14.1 says a server MUST
discard an Initial packet in a UDP datagram whose payload is smaller than
1200 bytes.

On the receive path nothing compares skb->len with QUIC_MIN_UDP_PAYLOAD.
quic_packet_rcv() and quic_packet_get_sock() only require
skb->len >= QUIC_HLEN.

Packets of any size can therefore reach the Version Negotiation reply
above, the Retry and refuse-close paths, and this call further down:

	req = quic_request_sock_create(sk, &odcid, retry, gfp);

When ALPN demux is disabled, the Length field isn't parsed at all. A
16-byte spoofed long-header Initial (8-byte DCID, empty SCID, empty
token) would allocate a quic_request_sock and call sk_acceptq_added().

Could a burst of these fill the accept queue, so that legitimate clients
hit sk_acceptq_is_full() and get CONNECTION_REFUSED?

Once the Version Negotiation and Retry builders are implemented, would
they also reply to spoofed sources for these small datagrams?

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but the comment says "backlog queue" while the function
drains deferred_list. struct quic_packet now has a separate backlog_list,
so should the comment say deferred list instead?

[Severity: Low]
These comments seem reversed compared to how this patch fills the fields.

quic_get_msg_addrs() takes (skb, da, sa), and quic_packet_listen_process()
calls it like this:

	quic_get_msg_addrs(skb, &packet->saddr, &packet->daddr);

The inline comment there says "Read Destination address (packet->saddr)
and Source address (packet->daddr)".

So packet->saddr holds the received packet's destination (local) address
and packet->daddr holds its source (peer) address. The users,
quic_crypto_verify_token(), quic_accept_sock_exists() and
quic_listen_sock_switch(), all follow that convention.

Could the struct comments be changed to match?

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but the function body doesn't select from a reuseport
group.

It walks the hash chain with sk_nulls_for_each_rcu() and returns the
first specific-address match, or an ANY-address candidate. It never calls
reuseport_select_sock() or looks at sk_reuseport_cb.

The v16 changelog says reuseport_select_sock() moved to the next
patchset. Should this part of the comment move with it?
