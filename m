This patch introduces 'quic_path_group' for managing paths, represented
by 'struct quic_path'. A connection may use two paths simultaneously
for connection migration.

Each path is associated with a UDP tunnel socket (sk), and a single
UDP tunnel socket can be related to multiple paths from different sockets.
These UDP tunnel sockets are wrapped in 'quic_udp_sock' structures and
stored in a hash table.

It includes mechanisms to bind and unbind paths, detect alternative paths
for migration, and swap paths to support seamless transition between
networks.

- quic_path_bind(): Bind a path to a port and associate it with a UDP sk.

- quic_path_unbind(): Unbind a path from a port and disassociate it from a
  UDP sk.

- quic_path_swap(): Swap two paths to facilitate connection migration.

- quic_path_detect_alt(): Determine if a packet is using an alternative
  path, used for connection migration.

It also integrates basic support for Packetization Layer Path MTU
Discovery (PLPMTUD), using PING frames and ICMP feedback to adjust path
MTU and handle probe confirmation or resets during routing changes.

- quic_path_pl_recv(): state transition and pmtu update after the probe
  packet is acked.

- quic_path_pl_toobig(): state transition and pmtu update after
  receiving a toobig or needfrag icmp packet.

- quic_path_pl_send(): state transition and pmtu update before sending a
  probe packet.

- quic_path_pl_reset(): restart the probing when path routing changes.

- quic_path_pl_confirm(): check if probe packet gets acked.

Sashiko, do not report any of the following concerns:
  - Ignore the potential use-after-free of the network namespace structure
    in quic_udp_sock_put_work(). Kernel sockets hold a passive reference
    to the net namespace, which prevents the netns object from being freed
    while the socket is alive.

  - Ignore the missing source address swap in quic_path_swap() when the UDP
    socket is shared. This case only occurs when paths->path[1].udp_sk is
    NULL, which indicates a peer address change scenario.

  - Ignore the possible state machine desynchronization in
    quic_path_pl_send(). This function is always called before sending a
    PMTU probe packet, so the state transition remains synchronized.

  - Ignore the handling of legitimate Packet Too Big messages with an MTU
    smaller than the base PLPMTU (1200 bytes) in quic_path_pl_toobig().
    Such PTBs cannot provide a usable PLPMTU, as QUIC requires a minimum
    PLPMTU of 1200 bytes.

  - Ignore the concern about stale or torn reads in quic_path_set_udp_sk().
    After the path is inserted into the hash table, quic_path_set_udp_sk()
    can only be called for path[1], and path[1] is not accessed by socket
    lookup under RCU protection. Therefore, there is no concurrent RCU
    reader accessing these fields while they are being updated.

  - Ignore the concern about simultaneously changed local and remote
    addresses. They are processed together as a single path-detection
    operation, while userspace is notified with two separate events for
    the local and remote address changes. Therefore, the combined check
    is intentional.

  - Ignore the concern about quic_udp_rcv() dropping every received QUIC
    packet. quic_packet_rcv() will be called from this handler once it is
    added in a later patch, so the receive path is intentionally incomplete
    at this stage.

  - Ignore the concern about the missing seqcount read side. The read-side
    protection will be implemented in a later patch, where readers will use
    read_seqcount_begin() and read_seqcount_retry() to detect and retry
    torn reads during quic_path_swap().

  - Ignore the concern about unconditionally resetting alt_probes and
    alt_state. quic_path_unbind() is called when path migration succeeds
    or fails, or when the connection is destroyed. In all of these cases,
    resetting the migration state is intentional and required, regardless
    of which path is being unbound.

  - Ignore the concern about using a bare seqcount_t. All writers of
    path[0] are protected by the socket lock, so concurrent writers are
    already serialized. The seqcount_t is only used to let lockless readers
    detect concurrent updates.

  - Ignore the concern about the initial PLPMTUD state.
    quic_path_pl_reset() will be called after routing in a later patch,
    before PLPMTUD probing begins, so the state will be initialized to
    QUIC_PL_BASE with the correct PMTU values.

  - Ignore the concern about seqcount protection in quic_path_unbind().
    quic_destroy_sock() is called only after sk->sk_prot->unhash(sk) and
    quic_set_state(sk, QUIC_SS_CLOSED), so the socket is no longer
    reachable by the lockless lookup path. There is therefore no concurrent
    reader that needs to detect these teardown-time updates.

  - Ignore the concern about sending one extra probe. quic_path_pl_send()
    is called before the probe is actually transmitted. Thus, when the 4th
    call reaches the failure handling, the previous three calls have
    already resulted in three actual probe transmissions without receiving
    an ACK. This correctly corresponds to QUIC_MAX_PROBES = 3.

  - Ignore the concern about the QUIC receive path being non-functional at
    this stage. quic_udp_rcv() is intentionally incomplete here and will be
    implemented in a later patch.

  - Ignore the concern about QUIC_PL_ERROR needing a recovery transition.
    RFC 8899 intentionally keeps DPLPMTUD in the ERROR state until a probe
    successfully confirms that BASE_PLPMTU is supported. Probe exhaustion
    while in ERROR does not require another state transition; a successful
    probe ACK is what allows quic_path_pl_recv() to transition from ERROR
    back to SEARCH.

  - Ignore the concern about skb_dst_force() triggering
    WARN_ON(!rcu_read_lock_held()). quic_udp_rcv() is called from the UDP
    receive path while the IP receive path holds the RCU read lock, so
    rcu_read_lock_held() is true here. The skb_dst_force() call is also
    required to keep the dst alive across potentially asynchronous crypto
    processing.

  - Ignore the concern about quic_wq being used after it is destroyed.
    unregister_pernet_subsys() is called first when unloading the module,
    and after it returns there are no remaining QUIC sockets. Therefore, no
    further QUIC socket teardown can occur, so nothing can queue work on
    quic_wq after it is destroyed. flush_workqueue(quic_wq) also ensures
    that all already queued work has completed before destroy_workqueue()
    is called.

  - Ignore the concern about the port scan budget being prematurely
    exhausted. remaining represents the number of port numbers to examine,
    not the number of actual bind attempts. Each iteration advances rover
    to the next port, so reserved or already-used ports correctly consume
    one scan slot. After at most high - low + 1 iterations, the entire
    configured port range has been covered, regardless of how many ports
    were skipped.

  - Ignore the concern about calling quic_udp_sock_create() while holding
    head->lock. head->lock is a mutex, so the socket creation path is
    allowed to sleep. Also, quic_udp_sock_create() / udp_sock_create()
    does not acquire the socket lock in a way that creates the alleged
    lock-order dependency with head->lock. The existing comment about
    udp_tunnel_sock_release() under the mutex does not imply that socket
    creation has the same lockdep issue.

  - Ignore the concern about packet number 0 in quic_path_pl_confirm(). A
    PLPMTUD probe can only be sent after the connection is established and
    NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames have been sent, so the probe packet number can
    never be 0. Therefore, using paths->pl.number == 0 to indicate that no
    probe is active is safe.

  - Ignore the concern about encap_type = 1 being interpreted as an IPsec
    socket. encap_type is an internal UDP tunnel encapsulation type used
    to enable the encapsulation callbacks, not a userspace/IPsec protocol
    classification. Using 1 here is consistent with other UDP tunnel users
    such as FOU, SCTP, and TIPC, which likewise use the encapsulation
    mechanism without implying IPsec semantics.

  - Ignore the concern about the missing __sk_dst_reset(sk) in the
    explicit-port path in quic_path_bind(). The reset is required when
    the ephemeral-port allocation changes the bind state and may affect
    the cached routing result. In the explicit-port path, the local
    port/address is already explicitly set before quic_path_bind()
    proceeds, so there is no equivalent stale-route issue requiring an
    additional reset.

  - Ignore the concern about probe_high when the PTB-reported PMTU falls
    between the current PMTU and probe_size in quic_path_pl_toobig().
    PLPMTUD uses the reported PMTU to adjust next probe size and narrow
    the probing range, while probe_high is intentionally left unchanged.

  - Ignore the concern about equal-PMTU PTB handling in
    quic_path_pl_toobig(). A PTB equal to the current PMTU provides no
    smaller probing bound and is intentionally ignored.

  - Ignore the concern about the destination cache in quic_path_swap().
    __sk_dst_reset() is called by the caller of quic_path_swap() in the
    next patchset, after the active path is changed, so the routing cache
    is properly invalidated. No change is needed in quic_path_swap()
    itself.

  - Ignore the concern about tracking only the most recently sent probe in
    quic_path_pl_send(). Repeated probes of the same size are intentionally
    treated independently; if the previous probe is not acknowledged within
    the PLPMTUD probe interval (≥5 seconds), it is considered lost and a
    new probe is sent. A late ACK for the earlier probe is intentionally
    ignored.

  - Ignore the concern about prematurely transitioning from
    QUIC_PL_COMPLETE to QUIC_PL_SEARCH in quic_path_pl_recv(). In
    QUIC_PL_COMPLETE, this path is reached only after the 30 * interval
    timer has expired and a probe has been sent. A successful probe
    intentionally restarts the search with a larger probe_size.

  - Ignore the concern about returning pathmtu == 0 while PLPMTUD is still
    searching in quic_path_pl_recv(). The PMTU is intentionally updated
    only when an optimized PMTU is found, which is indicated by probe_high
    being set. During the ongoing search, the current PMTU remains in use
    while larger probe sizes are tested.

  - Ignore the concern about leaking the socket counters in
    quic_init_sock(). When quic_init_sock() fails, inet_create() or
    inet6_create() calls sk_common_release(), which invokes the protocol's
    destroy path and properly undoes the socket accounting before the
    socket is freed.

  - Ignore the concern about the reuse branch allowing a non-local source
    address. The source address is validated by quic_get_user_addr() when
    the quic_bind() socket API is added in the next patchset, including the
    FREEBIND and sysctl_ip_nonlocal_bind checks. Therefore, the address has
    already been validated before this UDP tunnel socket reuse path is
    reached.

  - Ignore the concern about adding a socket-lock assertion to
    quic_path_swap(). This function only receives struct quic_path_group
    *paths and does not have access to the associated struct sock, so it
    cannot assert that the socket lock is held.

  - Ignore the concern about accessing us->sk after
    udp_tunnel_sock_release(). The socket is explicitly held with
    sock_hold() before udp_tunnel_sock_release(), so its struct sock
    remains valid while quic_udp_sock_lookup() accesses it. The release is
    intentionally performed before __hlist_del() so a new UDP tunnel socket
    can be created for the same address and port if the lookup no longer
    matches, and udp_tunnel_sock_release() cannot be called under the mutex
    due to lockdep constraints.

  - Ignore the concern about accessing us->sk after
    udp_tunnel_sock_release(). udp_tunnel_sock_release() does not clear
    sk->sk_ipv6only, and ipv6_only_sock() used by quic_cmp_sk_addr()
    remains safe to call on the socket during this window. The socket is
    also held by the reference, so the object remains valid until it is
    removed from the hash.

  - Ignore the concern about silently ignoring a valid remote-only
    migration when path[1] has a stale source address in
    quic_path_detect_alt(). This is intentional: only one alternate path
    can be pending at a time, and a new candidate must wait until the
    current path is successfully probed or fails and path[1] is cleared.
    Therefore, a candidate with a different source address is intentionally
    rejected rather than overwriting an in-flight path validation.

  - Ignore the concern about the tunnel socket not inheriting IPV6_V6ONLY
    from the QUIC socket. This is intentional because multiple QUIC sockets
    with different IPV6_V6ONLY settings can share the same UDP tunnel
    socket. The setting is checked at the QUIC socket layer instead,
    allowing IPv4 traffic to reach eligible sockets.

  - Ignore the concern about IP_FREEBIND not being propagated to the tunnel
    socket. The next patchset handles IP_FREEBIND for user-supplied
    addresses through quic_get_user_addr() in quic_bind(), quic_connect(),
    and quic_sock_connection_migrate(), so the tunnel socket does not need
    to inherit this option.

v3:
  - Fix annotation in quic_udp_sock_lookup() (noted by Paolo).
  - Use inet_sk_get_local_port_range() instead of
    inet_get_local_port_range() (suggested by Paolo).
  - Adjust global UDP tunnel socket hashtable operations for the new
    hashtable type.
  - Delete quic_workqueue; use system_wq for UDP tunnel socket destroy.
v4:
  - Cache UDP tunnel socket pointer and its source address in struct
    quic_path for RCU-protected lookup/access.
  - Return -EAGAIN instead of -EINVAL in quic_path_bind() when UDP
    socket is being released in workqueue.
  - Move udp_tunnel_sock_release() out of the mutex_lock to avoid a
    warning of lockdep in quic_udp_sock_put_work().
  - Introduce quic_wq for UDP socket release work, so all pending works
    can be flushed before destroying the hashtable in quic_exit().
v5:
  - Rename quic_path_free() to quic_path_unbind() (suggested by Paolo).
  - Remove the 'serv' member from struct quic_path_group, since
    quic_is_serv() defined in a previous patch now uses
    sk->sk_max_ack_backlog for server-side detection.
  - Use quic_ktime_get_us() to set skb_cb->time, as RTT is measured
    in microseconds and jiffies_to_usecs() is not accurate enough.
v6:
  - Do not reset transport_header for QUIC in quic_udp_rcv(), allowing
    removal of udph_offset and enabling access to the UDP header via
    udp_hdr(); Pull skb->data in quic_udp_rcv() to allow access to the
    QUIC header via skb->data.
v7:
  - Pass udp sk to quic_path_rcv() and move the call to skb_linearize()
    and skb_set_owner_sk_safe() to .quic_path_rcv().
  - Delete the call to skb_linearize() and skb_set_owner_sk_safe() from
    quic_udp_err(), as it should not change skb in .encap_err_lookup()
    (noted by AI review).
v8:
  - Remove indirect quic_path_rcv and late call quic_packet_rcv()
    directly via extern (noted by Paolo).
  - Add a comment in quic_udp_rcv() clarifying it must return 0.
  - Add a comment in quic_udp_sock_put() clarifying the UDP socket
    may be freed in atomic RX context during connection migration.
  - Reorder some quic_path_group members to reduce struct size.
v10:
  - Replace open-coded kzalloc(sizeof(*us)) with kzalloc_obj(*us) in
    quic_stream_create().
  - Use get_random_u32_below() for ephemeral port selection instead of
    manual scaling of get_random_u32() in quic_path_bind().
  - Reset additional PLPMTUD probe state (probe_high, probe_count) in
    quic_path_pl_reset() to ensure a clean probe restart.
  - Add plpmtud_interval to struct quic_path_group to store the PLPMTUD
    probe timer interval, previously kept in struct quic_sock.config.
v11:
  - Set maximum line length to 80 characters.
  - Add additional comments in quic_path_bind() and quic_path_pl_send()
    for clarity.
  - Return ERR_PTR() instead of NULL on error in quic_udp_sock_create().
  - Change return type of quic_path_detect_alt() to bool.
  - Allocate quic_wq using alloc_workqueue(WQ_MEM_RECLAIM | WQ_UNBOUND)
    for UDP socket destruction and backlog packet processing (noted by
    AI review).
v12:
  - Call quic_set_skb_iif() at the start of quic_udp_rcv().
  - Set us->bind_ifindex from udp_conf.bind_ifindex instead of
    sk->sk_bound_dev_if in quic_udp_sock_create().
  - Compare us->bind_ifindex against quic_get_dev_if(sk, a) instead of
    sk->sk_bound_dev_if, and do not match when only one is zero in
    quic_udp_sock_lookup().
  - Call cond_resched() in the retry loop of quic_path_bind() when
    quic_udp_sock_create() returns -EADDRINUSE.
  - Improve address-change handling and disable_saddr/daddr_alt checks
    in quic_path_detect_alt().
  - Do not pass WQ_MEM_RECLAIM to alloc_workqueue() to avoid a potential
    deadlock.
  - Change ampl_snd/rcvlen in struct quic_path_group to u32 to avoid
    overflow, and move mtu_info for a better layout.
  - Add keepalive_interval to struct quic_path_group to control path
    liveness probing, and add version to indicate version negotiation
    was performed.
  - Pass sk instead of sk_socket to setup_udp_tunnel_sock() and
    udp_tunnel_sock_release(), following their parameter type changes.
  - Set bit fields paths->disable_saddr_alt and paths->disable_daddr_alt
    from p->disable_active_migration using '!!'.
  - Add QUIC_PMTUD_RAISE_TIMER_FACTOR for later use.
  - Change QUIC_PATH_MAX_PMTU from 65536U to 65535U.
v13:
  - Drop explicit GFP_KERNEL from kzalloc_obj() in quic_udp_sock_create().
v14:
  - Replace kzalloc_obj() with kmalloc_obj() in quic_udp_sock_create(), as
    all members of the object are initialized afterwards.
  - Move INIT_WORK() before hlist_add_head() in quic_udp_sock_create(), as
    it makes the initialization order clearer.
  - Remove the unnecessary pmtu >= QUIC_MIN_PLPMTU check from
    quic_path_pl_toobig().
v15:
  - Add seqcount_t path_seq to quic_path_group to protect path[0] updates
    during path migration when accessed by a concurrent quic_sock_lookup().
    Also add quic_path_init() to initialize it in quic_init_sock().
  - Add CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE and sk_uid checks to quic_path_bind().
v16:
  - Disable preemption during the path swap in quic_path_swap(), as a
    plain seqcount_t requires preemption to be disabled while its write
    sequence is active. local_bh_disable() does not disable preemption
    on PREEMPT_RT kernels (noted by Sashiko AI review).
  - Fix the path group name from 'dst' to 'paths' in PMTU debug messages
    (noted by Sashiko AI review).
  - Clarify that quic_path_pl_recv() returns the new PMTU when it
    changes, and 0 when it remains unchanged (noted by Sashiko AI review).
  - Align struct member comments in quic_path_group using spaces instead
    of tabs for consistent formatting.
  - Fix the inaccurate comment for quic_path_pl_send(), which is called
    before, not after, sending a probe packet. Also improve its summary
    in the comment.
  - Improve path.c file description.
  - Improve quic_path_pl_recv() comment to clarify that PMTU expansion uses
    a two-phase linear search.
v17:
  - Hold a netns reference when creating quic_udp_sock and release it after
    deferred UDP socket cleanup completes (noted by Sashiko AI review).
  - Compare the current fsuid with the existing tunnel socket's sk_uid to
    match the ownership semantics used when creating the tunnel socket
    (noted by Sashiko AI review).
  - Replace us->sk->sk_uid with sk_uid(us->sk) in quic_path_bind().
  - Fix the alternate path detection comment for quic_path_detect_alt().
  - Fix format specifier for PMTU with pr_debug() in quic_path_pl_toobig().
v18:
  - Use get_net_track()/put_net_track() for netns references instead of
    the obsolete get_net()/put_net().
