There's the out of tree quic driver, that is used by some people
see https://github.com/lxin/quic.

And Samba 4.23 already uses the specific *_QUIC values,
so it would be good to make sure the values are not used for
something else, by accident.

Sure, but that still only works reliable if the constants
don't change.

The build hosts often don't have current kernel headers
anyway, that's why applications have the hard coded (at least fallback values).

But a host might have a newer kernel (or out of tree module)
at runtime, which would allow the application to use the feature.

It's mainly to have the constants reserved in order to avoid collisions
at runtime.

And in the current case also the merge conflict between the two patchsets,
that's another why I thought it would be good to the _QUIC patch already
accepted.

> We need at least to see the paired implementation to accept this patch,

I hope to post the first part of the _SMBDIRECT socket code next
week, it's already working for the in kernel users cifs.ko and ksmbd.ko,
but I want to split the relatively large commit into smaller chunks,
for better review, the current state consists of the top 3 commits of
https://git.samba.org/?p=metze/linux/wip.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/master-ipproto-smbdirect-v0.5
1. the addition of the socket layer above the existing code, for in kernel use only
2. change cifs.ko to use it
3. change ksmbd.ko to use it.

Opening it for userspace will be developed in the next weeks.

In general I'd agree with you, I'm fine with deferring this patch
a bit and will cope if the _QUIC patch is also deferred.

Anyway thanks for the feedback!
