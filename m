This patch uses 'quic_packet' to handle packing of QUIC packets on the
receive (RX) path.

It introduces mechanisms to parse the ALPN from client Initial packets
to determine the correct listener socket. Received packets are then
routed and processed accordingly. Similar to the TX path, handling for
application and handshake packets is not yet implemented.

- quic_packet_get_alpn(): Parse the ALPN from a client Initial packet,
  then locate the appropriate listener using the ALPN.

- quic_packet_rcv(): Locate the appropriate socket to handle the packet
  via quic_packet_process().

- quic_packet_process(): Process the received packet.

In addition to packet flow, this patch adds support for ICMP-based MTU
updates by locating the relevant socket and updating the stored PMTU
accordingly.

- quic_packet_rcv_err_pmtu(): Find the socket and update the PMTU via
  quic_packet_mss_update().

Sashiko, do not report any of the following concerns:
  - Ignore the potential UaF of ALPN data in quic_listen_sock_lookup().
    The lookup is protected by RCU, and the socket lifetime is managed
    such that quic_sock_destruct() is not executed until after all RCU
    readers have completed. The ALPN data is therefore not freed while an
    RCU reader can still access it. Note that SOCK_RCU_FREE will always be
    set when the socket is inserted into the hash table by quic_hash() in
    the next patchset; without quic_hash(), the socket can never be present
    in the listener hash table accessed by quic_listen_sock_lookup().
    There is therefore no need to replace quic_data_free() with a
    kfree_rcu()-based approach or add a separate assertion that
    SOCK_RCU_FREE is set before insertion. Please do not report this
    concern again.

  - Ignore the potential use-after-free of qn from quic_udp_rcv(). Netns
    teardown stops packet reception before invoking per-netns cleanup
    callbacks. Since quic_net_exit() is only called after devices and their
    ingress paths have been released, no new UDP tunnel packets can reach
    quic_udp_rcv() during or after this callback.

  - Ignore the concern about the fallback lookup order in
    quic_packet_get_sock(). conn_id is added only after both sides have
    successfully confirmed it, so if its lookup fails, the connection is
    considered gone; the server then falls back to the listen socket to
    generate a stateless reset, while the client normally has no listen
    socket and proceeds to quic_sock_lookup() to process the packet as a
    stateless reset.

  - Ignore the concern about the missing RCU read lock for
    quic_conn_id_lookup(). quic_packet_rcv() is called on the RX path under
    rcu_read_lock(), so quic_packet_get_sock() and quic_conn_id_lookup()
    already execute within the required RCU read-side critical section.
    rcu_read_lock() is explicitly called by ip_local_deliver_finish() on
    the RX path.

  - Ignore the concern about the return value of quic_udp_err().
    quic_udp_err() must return 1 when QUIC handles the ICMP error so that
    UDP does not perform its own ICMP processing. Although
    __udp4_lib_err_encap_no_sk() may subsequently be called, it will not
    match this UDP tunnel socket because it is already being used by QUIC,
    so no double processing occurs.  Returning 0 would allow UDP to handle
    the ICMP message itself in udp_err().

  - Ignore the concern about the missing len < length check after
    quic_get_int() for alpns in quic_listen_sock_lookup(). alpns is built
    by quic_packet_get_alpn(), which validates each ALPN entry and
    guarantees that the remaining length is at least the decoded entry
    length before quic_listen_sock_lookup() processes it.

  - Ignore the concern about returning 0 for non-PTB ICMP errors. A return
    value of 0 intentionally lets the UDP layer continue its normal ICMP
    error processing when QUIC does not handle the error. Only ICMP Packet
    Too Big errors accepted by QUIC's PMTU handling are consumed by the
    QUIC path and should return 1.

  - Ignore the concern about conflating the return values in
    quic_packet_deferred_schedule(). It intentionally uses any non-zero
    return value to indicate that the SKB has been consumed, either by
    successfully queuing it (1) or by dropping and freeing it (-ENOBUFS).
    The caller therefore must treat any non-zero return as consumed and
    return -EINPROGRESS to prevent further processing or freeing of the
    SKB.

  - Ignore the concern about quic_alpn_demux_key never being enabled. The
    static key is intentionally enabled when ALPN is configured on a
    listening socket in the next patchset. Until then, ALPN demux
    correctly remains disabled, so the ALPN parsing and backlog paths are
    intentionally unreachable in this patch.

  - Ignore the concern about quic_packet_rcv_err_pmtu() sleeping in atomic
    context. The routing lookup functions used by quic_packet_route(),
    including ip_route_output_flow(), do not sleep and are safe to call
    from atomic context. Therefore, calling quic_packet_rcv_err_pmtu() from
    quic_release_cb() or under bh_lock_sock() does not introduce a
    sleeping-in-atomic-context issue.

  - Ignore the concern about SO_REUSEPORT load balancing in
    quic_listen_sock_lookup(). da represents the peer's destination address
    and port in this lookup context, not the server's local address and
    port. Therefore, quic_addr_hash(net, da) varies with the peer address/
    port and does not produce a constant hash for all incoming connections.

  - Ignore the concern about the socket reference count in
    quic_packet_get_sock(). quic_conn_id_lookup() takes a reference
    to the associated socket before returning the conn_id, so
    quic_conn_id_sk(conn_id) returns a socket with a valid reference held.
    The sock_put(sk) in quic_packet_rcv() therefore correctly releases that
    reference.

  - Ignore the concern about packet->level being left in an incorrect
    encryption state in quic_packet_rcv_err_pmtu(). packet->level is
    updated to the appropriate encryption level from the frames whenever
    packets are sent, so the PMTU update does not permanently affect the
    outgoing packet encryption level.

  - Ignore the concern about the -ENOENT return value suppressing UDP
    ICMP processing in quic_packet_rcv_err_pmtu(). If quic_sock_lookup()
    cannot find a QUIC socket associated with this UDP tunnel socket, the
    ICMP error should not be processed by the UDP layer either. Returning
    -ENOENT correctly indicates that there is no QUIC socket to handle the
    error, and no normal UDP ICMP processing is expected in this case.

  - Ignore the concern about truncated TLS ClientHello messages bypassing
    ALPN demultiplexing in quic_packet_get_alpn(). Truncated or incomplete
    TLS ClientHello messages are currently unsupported and are not expected
    to reach the ALPN demultiplexing path. Returning 0 for such packets is
    therefore intentional.

  - Ignore the concern about a divide-by-zero in
    quic_request_sock_backlog_tail(). sk->sk_max_ack_backlog can never be 0
    when this function is called. A listen(fd, 0) causes the listening
    socket to leave the listening state and be removed from the listen hash
    table, so quic_request_sock_backlog_tail() cannot be reached with
    sk->sk_max_ack_backlog == 0.

  - Ignore the concern about leaking quic_request_sock structures and their
    backlog packets during socket destruction. quic_reqs(sk) is cleared in
    quic_unhash() before quic_destroy_sock() is called in the next
    patchset, so any pending request sockets and their associated backlog
    packets are freed before reaching this cleanup path.

  - Ignore the concern about a double-free when
    quic_packet_app_process() or quic_packet_listen_process() returns an
    error after freeing the skb. In __release_sock(), a non-zero return
    value does not cause the networking core to free the skb again.
    Therefore, freeing the skb here before returning -EOPNOTSUPP does not
    result in a double-free.

  - Ignore the concern about skb_set_owner_sk_safe() triggering a
    spurious warning for deferred packets. skb_set_owner_sk_safe() does
    not fail when skb->sk or skb->destructor is already set. Therefore,
    when a deferred packet is processed again, this call succeeds and does
    not trigger a spurious WARN_ON_ONCE().

  - Ignore the concern about uninitialized padding in quic_addr affecting
    token validation in quic_packet_listen_process(). quic_get_msg_addrs()
    zeroes packet->daddr and packet->saddr before populating the addresses
    for every packet. Therefore, any padding in the address union is
    initialized to zero and cannot contain stale data from a previous IPv6
    packet.

  - Ignore the concern about using GFP_KERNEL in quic_packet_get_alpn().
    This function is called from quic_packet_listen_process() only after
    quic_packet_deferred_schedule() has been checked, so the ALPN
    decryption path runs from the deferred workqueue in sleepable process
    context. Therefore, GFP_KERNEL is safe here.

v5:
  - In quic_packet_rcv_err(), remove the unnecessary quic_is_listen()
    check and move quic_get_mtu_info() out of sock lock (suggested
    by Paolo).
  - Replace cancel_work_sync() to disable_work_sync() (suggested by
    Paolo).
v6:
  - Fix the loop using skb_dequeue() in quic_packet_backlog_work(), and
    kfree_skb() when sk is not found (reported by AI Reviews).
  - Remove skb_pull() from quic_packet_rcv(), since it is now handled
    in quic_path_rcv().
  - Note for AI reviews: add if (dst) check in quic_packet_rcv_err_pmtu(),
    although quic_packet_route() >= 0 already guarantees it is not NULL.
  - Note for AI reviews: it is safe to do *plen -= QUIC_HLEN in
    quic_packet_get_version_and_connid(), since quic_packet_get_sock()
    already checks if (skb->len < QUIC_HLEN).
  - Note for AI reviews: cb->length - cb->number_len - QUIC_TAG_LEN
    cannot underflow, because quic_crypto_header_decrypt() already checks
    if (cb->length < QUIC_PN_MAX_LEN + QUIC_SAMPLE_LEN).
  - Note for AI reviews: the cast length in quic_packet_parse_alpn()
    is safe, as there is a prior check if (length > (u16)len); len is
    skb->len, which cannot exceed U16_MAX for UDP packet with QUIC.
  - Note for AI reviews: it's correct to do if (flags &
    QUIC_F_MTU_REDUCED_DEFERRED) in quic_release_cb(), since
    QUIC_MTU_REDUCED_DEFERRED is the bit used with test_and_set_bit().
  - Note for AI reviews: move skb_cb->backlog = 1 before adding skb to
    backlog, although it's safe to write skb_cb after adding to backlog
    with sk_lock.slock, as skb dequeue from backlog requires sk_lock.slock.
v7:
  - Pass udp sk to quic_packet_rcv(), quic_packet_rcv_err() and
    quic_sock_lookup().
  - Move the call to skb_linearize() and skb_set_owner_sk_safe() to
    .quic_path_rcv()/quic_packet_rcv().
v8:
  - Replace the global ALPN demultiplexing sysctl with the static key in
    quic_packet_parse_alpn() (noted by Stefan).
  - Refetch skb->data after decrypt in ALPN parsing, as skb_cow_data()
    may reallocate the skb data buffer (reported by Syzkaller).
  - The indirect quic_path_rcv has been removed and call quic_packet_rcv()
    directly via extern.
  - Do not restore skb data when QUIC Initial decryption fails, as the
    caller will free the skb for this failure anyway.
  - With patch 14 removed, define a temporary QUIC_FRAME_CRYPTO ID when
    parsing the ALPN.
v9:
  - Remove local_bh_disable() in quic_packet_get_listen_sock() as it's now
    using rcu_read_lock instead of spin_sock in quic_listen_sock_lookup()
    (noted by Paolo).
v10:
  - Return QUIC_PACKET_INVALID (instead of -1) for invalid packet types in
    quic_packet_version_get_type().
  - Update the comment to clarify in quic_packet_rcv_err() that ICMP errors
    embed the original QUIC packet, reversing src/dst addrs when parsed.
  - Use qn->backlog_list.lock in quic_packet_backlog_schedule() to
    prevent a TOCTOU race between the head->qlen check and its update in
    __skb_queue_tail().
  - Add check 'len < TLS_CH_RANDOM_LEN + TLS_CH_VERSION_LEN' before parsing
    ClientHello in quic_packet_get_alpn().
  - Add more limits in quic_packet_get_alpn() to improve robustness against
    malformed TLS ClientHello messages.
  - Move skb_queue_purge() to after disable_work_sync() in quic_net_exit()
    for clarity and to satisfy AI review.
  - quic_sock.config.plpmtud_probe_interval has been moved to
    quic_path_group.plpmtud_interval, so update its usage in
    quic_packet_rcv_err_pmtu() accordingly.
  - Remove quic_packet_select_version() and quic_packet_version_change();
    they will be reintroduced later when needed in the next patch series.
v11:
  - Note for AI review: refcount increments in quic_listen_sock_lookup()
    and quic_sock_lookup() are left unchanged due to code complexity.
  - Set maximum line length to 80 characters.
  - Do not mark backlog packets as sleepable (cb->backlog = 1) in
    sk_add_backlog path; Replace spin_(un)lock() with spin_(un)lock_bh()
    in quic_packet_backlog_schedule().
  - Return -ENOBUFS instead of -1 in quic_packet_backlog_schedule().
  - Change err parameter type from u8 to bool (icmp) in quic_packet_rcv().
  - Propagate errors from quic_packet_get_sock() and sk_add_backlog() in
    quic_packet_rcv().
  - Propagate errors from quic_packet_get_dcid() and
    quic_packet_parse_alpn() in quic_packet_get_sock() via ERR_PTR().
  - Propagate errors from quic_packet_parse_alpn() in
    quic_packet_get_listen_sock() via ERR_PTR().
  - Propagate errors from quic_packet_get_version_and_connid() and
    quic_packet_get_token() in quic_packet_parse_alpn().
  - Do not hold skb when calling quic_packet_backlog_schedule() in
    quic_packet_parse_alpn(); do not free skb when returning
    -EINPROGRESS from quic_packet_get_sock() in quic_packet_rcv().
  - Move the quic_packet_rcv() declaration from packet.h to path.h,
    as it's only called in path.c (noted by AI review).
  - Merge quic_packet_get_dcid() and quic_packet_get_version_and_connid()
    into quic_packet_get_long_header() and extract quic_packet_get_connid()
    (noted by AI review).
v12:
  - Check quic_is_closed() in quic_packet_rcv_err_pmtu().
  - Remove the ip_sk_accept_pmtu() check from quic_packet_rcv_err_pmtu(),
    and check quic_sk_accept_pmtu() in quic_packet_rcv_err().
  - Call cond_resched() in the loop inside quic_packet_backlog_work().
  - Update the comment for the get_nulls_value(node) check in
    quic_sock_lookup(), and remove the unnecessary get_nulls_value(node)
    check and add comment for it in quic_listen_sock_lookup().
  - Improve matching order: specific address > ANY address (same family) >
    ANY address (different family) in quic_listen_sock_lookup().
  - Defer quic_alpn destruction from quic_destroy_sock() to
    quic_sock_destruct(), as it may still be accessed in
    quic_listen_sock_lookup() under rcu_read_lock().
  - Initialize dcid/scid variables at declaration in quic_packet_get_sock()
    and quic_packet_parse_alpn().
  - Set packet->level before calling quic_packet_taglen() in
    quic_packet_rcv_err_pmtu().
  - Set cb->sync to 1 to ensure decryption runs in sync mode.
v13:
  - Add comment explaining why ALPN free is deferred in
    quic_sock_destruct().
  - Improve loop boundary check while parsing ALPN extensions in
    quic_packet_get_alpn().
v14:
  - Pass gfp flags to quic_packet_process(), quic_packet_app_process(),
    quic_packet_handshake_process(), and quic_packet_listen_process()
    for allocations in subsequent patches.
  - Define quic_backlog_rcv() as .backlog_rcv() and pass GFP_ATOMIC to
    quic_packet_process().
  - Pass GFP_KERNEL to quic_packet_process() in
    quic_packet_backlog_work().
  - Move the exts++ check to the beginning of the while loop in
    quic_packet_get_alpn() (noted by Sashiko AI review).
v15:
  - Drop the redundant .backlog_rcv definition, which already exists.
  - Read path[0] under read_seqcount_begin() and read_seqcount_retry()
    protection in quic_sock_lookup().
  - Merge the two lookup paths into a single socket iteration and check
    all client ALPNs for each socket in quic_listen_sock_lookup().
  - Add quic_packet_listen_process() to process the first Initial packet
    from a peer, including token validation, request socket creation, and
    enqueuing. Add the stateless reset, version negotiation, and Retry
    packet trigger logic without implementing their packet creation yet.
  - Add quic_accept_sock_exists() to use an existing accept socket when
    processing an skb in quic_packet_listen_process(), in case accept()
    was called while the skb was in the backlog.
  - Pass usk to quic_listen_sock_lookup() and quic_packet_get_sock()
    instead of retrieving it from skb->sk, and remove the
    skb_set_owner_sk_safe() call from quic_packet_rcv().
  - Add a temporary validate_peer_address member to struct quic_packet
    for Retry triggering in quic_packet_listen_process(). Replace it with
    the outq validate_peer_address member when struct quic_outqueue is
    added in the next patchset.
  - Make the work per socket instead of per netns:
    - Move backlog_list from struct quic_net to struct quic_packet and
      rename it to deferred_list. Add backlog_list to struct quic_packet
      to hold packets waiting for crypto keys or Initial packets from
      clients to be processed in quic_accept().
    - Rename quic_packet_backlog_schedule() to _deferred_schedule(),
      checking sk_rcvbuf before adding packets to deferred_list, and
      rename quic_packet_backlog_work() to _deferred_work() to process
      packets from deferred_list.
    - Remove quic_packet_parse_alpn() from quic_packet_get_sock() and
      the err == -EINPROGRESS check from quic_packet_rcv(). Merge
      quic_packet_parse_alpn() into _get_alpn() and call it from
      quic_packet_listen_process(), then add quic_listen_sock_switch()
      to switch the listen socket if a new socket is found by ALPN
      through the workqueue.
